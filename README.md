# Malloc

Reimplement Malloc function from C standard library.

To test my implementation clone the repository, compile the shared lib using ``make`` and compile a test main or any program using malloc with the library ``libmy_malloc.so``. If you want to be sure to load this malloc you can load the symbol using ``dlopen``, ``dlsym()`` and ``dlclose()``.
